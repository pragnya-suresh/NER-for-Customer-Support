           "I agree with all the positive reviews regarding the quality of the rice, but I have to give this rice cooker 2 stars on the basis of its poor quality of construction. We've had this cooker for 5 months. The removable inner lid was recently dropped from a height of &lt; 4feet. This short drop resulted in one of the tabs breaking off the inner lid. Since it was so new, I figured it would be under warranty, but Zojirushi said this wasn't covered and I had to pay for a new part ($15 with slow shipping, 10 days). I expected either better construction or better warranty coverage from a $155 rice cooker. (Now, effectively a $170 rice cooker for me) :(\n", 'People who haven\'t used this phone can\'t understand why I dislike it so much because it is supposed to be so "cool". I bought it because it was one of the only Verizon phones that seemed likely to work with my Macintosh and iSync to transfer contacts over Bluetooth. While I had mixed success in that regard there is lots of other things about this phone to not recommend it.As for the physical form; the screen is an absolute blank outdoors in any kind of sunlight, the speaker phone key on the side is easy to accidently activate and I was constantly broadcasting my calls to everybody until I learned to be more careful, the same thing with the voice menu key on the other side, and the center select button on the 4-way navigation key is very difficult to push for anybody with fingers larger than Barbie (I had some success using my fingernails until I trimmed them).The user interface is horrible and I wonder if anybody actually tests these things; it can play music and take pictures but still has only one lousy field for the contact name (forget about sorting by last name or trying to keep track of a contact by their company name), all contacts get assigned speed dials and they must be moved, not deleted (very tedious to organize and so I only did it for the first 10 or so speed dials), you don\'t know for sure what speed dial number you are calling until the call has been initiated (unlike my old phone that would display the contact before making the call; I know they are speed dials but I don\'t always remember which number I assigned), it takes several key presses to activate "vibrate only" (as opposed to one convenient key press on my old phone), get used to the "get it now menu" and the "mobile web" because most of the navigation keys manage to take you there (there is only one assignable navigation key press and it can\'t be "recent calls", something I used a lot on my old, uncool phone) , backing out of menus is inconsistent (sometimes it is a soft key, sometimes the clear key, sometimes the end key), assignments made for speed dial or custom ringtones don\'t always seem to stick (for instance, the speed dial number seems to work as assigned but the "contacts" listing shows a different speed dial), and the "iTap" predictive text entry mode is a joke (producing nothing but esperanto for my simple messages). That is enough for now but I could go on.I was able to transfer my contacts to the phone using iSync but I did not try anything with the calendar. Besides the name limitation mentioned above, only "mobile", "home" and "work" numbers are recognized (in addition to email and fax). A subsequent sync overwrote all my speed dial assignments. Given the difficulties with that feature (see above) I don\'t think I will do that again soon.The voice quality and reception are good but using this phone is frustrating.\n', "Don't waste your money on these. They don't grind well at all. I just bought celtic sea salts and got rid of my table salt and was very disappointed as these just don't grind the salt or pepper. I have to go buy another set and hope they work.\n", "although it said it was a factory replacement for my phone, the V3xx, it doesn't fit quite right, and it doesn't hold a charge overnight if the phone is left on...Just not sure about the quality of these motorola batteries...\n", 'None of the gels came close to fitting in my ear - I ended up using the little rubber ring in the kit on my Jabra bluetooth to keep it from slipping out.

All of them have unraveled stitching during the first wash causing the underwire to poke out. All were hand washed and were hung to dry so I'm afraid it can't be blamed on machines. I'm greatly disappointed\n", 'I ordered a black and blue razr phone thinking there was absolutely no difference between the two except for color. My wife\'s phone, the black razr, has excellent reception. In contrast, the blue razr, has little to no reception. I exchanged it for another blue razr and discovered the same problem. Irritated and frustrated I decided to switch to the black razr thinking there might have been a manufacturing defect on the blue razr\'s. I received my black razr yesterday and voila the reception is far superior than the blue (which is supposedly the exact same phone). Of course my wife\'s phone still has better and consistent reception for some reason; Maybe because it is considered the primary phone it has better reception. My thinking is that if you wish to purchase a blue razr, you should wait a month or so before purchasing. Wait for those "defective" batches of blue razr\'s to be out of the system. Or, I just may have been an unlucky person to have gotten two defective blue phones in a row.\n', 'very loose fit on the ear and hard to reconnect if you go out of range\n', "I am usually adept at putting things together but this chair was challenging since many of the holes for screws didn't align properly and it was impossible to put together properly. Furthermore, there were no directions concerning the wheels/casters at the bottom. I thought perhaps it was self explanatory but when trying to put them in,they didn't seem to latch in and everytime one sits in the chair it practically collapses because of a loose caster.

I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed.\n', 'If you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washing then this is the shirt for you.Be aware that Amazon has a $3.99 plus $0.99(per item) return shipping fee.Is all Bill Blass stuff this "quality"?\n', "I received this and found that I can't plug it into the wall and the computer at the same time, according to the instructions.

I am currently requesting a refund and will try the Palm Cradle instead.\n", 'I ordered several designs of the Cacharel shirts and was very disappointed when they arrived because the fabric was extremely thin. I always wear a white undershirt, and that fact was very evident since one could literally see through the shirt.\n', "I had high hopes for the top-end Keurig machine. Lots of size options, control of water temperature, ability to make iced drinks. So I bought it. Immediately found out that most of the K-cups I tried had a slightly burnt flavor--and I tried lots of types, Green Mountain, Caribou, Coffee People, Timothy's. Found out that the Green Mountain Kenya AA did not taste burnt, so I might suggest sticking with that--if your machine should happen to keep working.Within about six months, mine decided to have spasms of not brewing--boiling, spitting--but nothing coming out of the spout. Read a few other posts--people suggested removing the water reservoir, that this breaks a vacuum. Did that. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. Tried the old give it a tap where the pump seems to be located. Worked sometimes, not others. Today, total death. So I paid almost 200 bucks for something that works some of the time for 18 months. Ugh. Stay away.\n", "Normally, you'd expect a company to understand a man and his underwear. Sadly, UA does not.When I received this underwear, I was able to wear it once. Once. Why? Because it simply fell the hell apart half way through my day as I was wearing it.Chances are, this is just a defective case. Yeah, probably. So what do I do? I go and contact UA support. First of all, I had to continuously try to get them to actually talk to me. I'd say I had a problem with their underwear breaking down on me. What do they say? To use the return form and send it back, followed by an immediate disconnection! I had to try continuously contacting them to get them to say anything else what so ever. When I finally do, I ask whether or not I could just provide proof of purchase (a receipt + picture). They simply deny me.I mean, really. Sending back a gross, dirty pair of underwear that you sweated in all day to the point they break isn't something you want to do. After denying me, they refused to talk to me whatsoever. They simply disconnect as soon as I enter the chat, refusing to talk to me at all! Furthermore, their employees constantly gave attitude and belittled me at the same time.UA, you're a damn shame. A damn shame.\n", "I enjoy the features of the phone, however there are too many kinks.I am on my second replacement since Mar '05. The first phone had a mysterious orange blob that seemed to migrate on the screen, and a strange humming. The replacement worked for one month and also has a strange hum. The third phone is in route via mail.I have not had any problems with Cingular. They don't seem surprised by my complaints and promptly send replacements. However, I am looking into purchasing a Blackberry, instead.\n", 'In a nutshell: Verizon has made this phone mediocre. If you gotta have a V3m, get one from another carrier.The Razr V3m\'s sharp looks, respectable battery life and fidelity are marred by Verizon\'s sluggish interface and crippled features. If all you want is a thin profiled phone, then you\'ll probably be happy with this item - and many places offer them up for free. But those searching for a "media" rich phone should keep looking.The "IN" calling feature can save you a bundle if friends and family are Verizon subscribers. BUT...If you are at all interested in customizing the V3m with ringtones, wallpaper and such, be prepared to hand fistfulls of cash to the VCAST service or spend oodles of time trolling the net for info on hacks (of which there are plenty - for Windows users).The built-in camera is just okay. With the placement of the lens near the hinge you\'re bound to end up with an index finger in many a shot. The same holds true for the video camera feature - not that you\'ll use it much since its record time is limited to 15 seconds.You can playback .wma files stored on a transflash card (that\'s next to the battery that must be removed to access the card) but there\'s no 3.5mm headphone port; A USB dongle adapter is in box. Note: the largest card you can use is a 1GB.No USB cable is included despite the V3m\'s disabled OBEX feature (which allows the transferring of files via bluetooth). Razrs from Sprint, T-Mobile, Cingular an All-Tell have this feature intact!pros:compact sizerespectable sound qualitycan check voicemail from another phonecons:Many important wireless functions disabled!

I own a whole collection of their bakeware, and I've been more than happy with all the items. The last bakeware I had to replace was my muffin pans. I make double batches of cookies and cupcakes, so I ordered two of these. They're beautiful. Solid aluminum, guaranteed not to rust. HOWEVER... upon using them for the first time, both pans were dented as I tried to close the oven door, and the door did not close. They do not fit lengthwise in a standard sized large oven! If you bake double batches, you cannot place these side by side. If you only bake one batch at a time, they're fine. If you make 24, just buy ONE pan and be prepared to spend twice the time in the kitchen making a second batch. I'm more than shocked that Doughmaker's designed something with such a glaring flaw. Very disappointed!\n", 'The first Logitech Mobile Bluetooth Headset I got was DOA -- the headset would not charge. The replacement unit was defective as well -- annoying electronic tones in the earpiece, unreliable charging, and after a few days the microphone went haywire and started generating a very loud, constant buzzing/static background noise, drowning out the speaker\'s voice. Logitech support was non-existent. This was to be my wife\'s "big" Christmas present, but it was nothing but a big disappointment. An important footnote: Amazon handled the replacement and returns graciously and promptly, entirely at their expense -- no complaints about that!\n', 'I purchased an Apple I Phone 3 from Amazon warehouse for my sons Christmas gift. After opening on Christmas day we discovered the phone would not do anything. We brought it the next day to the Apple store to find out that only the outside was a real I phone everything inside of the phone was fake. Very disappointed.\n', "After a month of use on this phone I have enough input to rate it. I am on the T-mobile network. I have owned Nokia 5160, 6162, and 8265.First the positives :)1. Very stylish2. Camera function3. Attaches pictures to call contacts4. Decent graphics and colors5. Blue tooth6. Black Jack game - sonyericsson.com7. Good polyphonic sound8. Reliable - Hasn't crashed or got stuck9. Small- not a bother to carry aroundNegatives :(1. Piss poor reception at times, my other phone got better reception- May be t-mobile2.

Scratches easily and the screen gets so dirtyHope this helps. That's all I can think about right now. I am used to Nokia but the idea of a camera phone made me curious and the 3650 was too large. Nokia 6600 camera phone with camera will be out soon. I'd give it 2.5 stars right in the middle but there was none, so I went down. Don't buy this novelty phone if you log a lot of minutes!\n", "I have changed to GSM and selected the V3xx phone as the Motoroal V60 was the best phone I have ever owned. The Razr V3xx has some short commings that anyone considering it should know about. First of all you have to have the phone really centered on your ear to hear it at its best 1/4 inch makes a difference. The front screen is too small to read incoming call numbers, so it is useless for caller ID. Both inside and external screens are hard to read in bright sunlight. The srceens are great in reduced light or indoors. The start call(green) and end call(red) buttons are right next to buttons that start the AT&T browser or CV both of which will cost you if you press one by mistake and cancel as quickly as posible, you learn to look at the buttons you are pressing, not a good idea if you are driving. I have not been able to find a good blue tooth device to use while driving. I have purchased two units with built in speakers and three ear piece devices. The best is the Motorola H700 (I bought it from Amazon to avoid fake look alikes and the $99.00 asked by AT&T). The H700 is scratchy but usable in a car. The quality and volume of the blue tooth on any of the devices I have tried is about equal to the built in speaker. The last issue with the phone is battery life, if I am lucky I get two days charge on a battery. I probably place or receive four to five short calls a day. Sometimes I run out of battery on the second day, so now I just plug the phone in each night. My old phones Nokias, Motorolas, and Panasonics (all digital not GSM) lasted between one or two weeks on a charge. I guess I'll have to adjust to the new technology!\n", '...I have ever worn. I hope they keep making them forever!\n', 'The product states that inches will be removed after 30 days of use and I have worn this item everyday for at least 12 hrs per day and I have not seen any kind of difference.For the price of the item, it is disappointing when it advertises and does not comply.\n', 'I bought the charger, along with 2 spare batteries.

Suprised to see A company very well known for quality products can make something very slimy.\n', 'EDIT: We are returning this item to Amazon for refund. I contacted Anchor Hocking customer care and received a call back. They wanted me to return to them for analysis in their labs to see why this item made it through their quality control process. Unfortunately for all, we needed to go out and purchase a new one locally for a party we were having in 2 days. Returning to them would have resulted in them sending out a replacement, leaving us with 2 of these.We ended up purchasing for $10 ($15.00 less than here at Amazon) at Bed Bath and Beyond, getting the fluted model. Sadly, my wife had to mix and match a base from one box and a top from another to get the least flawed product possible. Even then, the best top has a noticeable flaw in the glass, again not physically felt from the outside.I don\'t know what\'s wrong with Anchor Hocking, but honestly for $10.00 and American Made, I\'m willing to accept the minor flaw in the one we have. Or....we will carry it around with us and should we find one that\'s flawless we will exchange. It\'s not like we don\'t pass by a dozen Bed, Bath, Beyonds in our travels.I should mention, it\'s not a minor ripple as you see in glass. It\'s an actual flaw in the glass.Original post:First, we loved that it was made it America and therefore were willing to pay the current price of $35.00. Purchasing sight unseen was a huge mistake for this product so we warn you away.The quality of the glass is quite poor. It\'s not crystal clear at all, has imperfections throughout and that\'s not even the reason we returned it.There was a very large ripple in the glass at about a 45 degree angle running down one of the sides. Worse, far worse is there was literally a flake of something around 3/8" across embedded fully in the glass on the cover, very visible. You could not feel it from either side. It\'s perfectly in the middle of the glass. It was a shard of something.This item should NEVER have made it through whatever inspection process Anchor Hocking employs. I\'m so disappointed in this American company that I intend to contact their headquarters and let them know our experience.We have a party in 2 days and now will be on the search locally for a replacement. I was fearful this would happen. I don\'t know what technology is used these days in making glass but there is the crystal clear type you see coming out of factories in Poland (for example glasses sold at various places in sets) and then there is the imperfect glass you see with imperfections throughout: ripples I call them. This product is definitely made with the latter process. By no means is this glass that perfect Pyrex type, or what Corning puts out. I\'m more disappointed that a Made in America product disappointed me so much than the fact that we now must add this to our list of errands to run, including the return of the product to the UPS store for drop off.Buyer beware. Anchor Hocking needs a better inspection process with whatever method of glass making they use.\n', 'I wish there was a way I could give this ZERO stars. The quality is awful. The "satin" looks like pleather and the feel is disgustingly cheap.It also does not fit true to size. According to measurements, I fit into a size large. Apparently the tape measure they have at the factory is not the same as mine.Now, I\'m stuck with having to find a dress in less than a month.\n', 'It has a samsung logo, but it looks fake after I bought it. The belt clipper tore of the phone holder with no reason.\n', 'I saw this product thinking it would work pretty well, but it does not. I just got this item in the mail today and took it straight out to my car to try it with my ipod and it does not work. You press play and it does not give out the full sound of the song. The only way you can get the full sound is if you mess with the connection to the ipod, but even then you only get it for a few seconds. I suggest going with any fm transmitter that connects to your ipod via the bottom usb connector, rather than the headphone port, it works much better\n', "Don't be fooled because it is made by PalmOne and made for the Treo 650. This product is terrible. You would think that it would be a great product since it comes from the manufacturer of the hardware that fits in it. This is not so. The camera is not revealed. You have to unsnap the top strap and fold down the back falp to use the Camera. You have to unsnap it whenever you need to to beam or receive a beam. Unsnapping it will eventually lead to you forgetting to snap it back and you will drop the Treo 650 sooner or later. The top right corner is not covered. If you drop it while it is in the case the corner is not protected. Krusell makes a better case than PalmOne.\n", "Don't always believe what you see advertised on Amazon. Amazon shipped me the smaller version of the fan it advertised but still charged me the same higher price for the large fan it should have sent. I sent the small fan back to Amazon and ordered what I should have received from Kaz.com. The product is great, Amazon's service wasn't.\n", "I pretty much agree with all the reviews. The phone is a great looking piece of rubbish! My aim was to find a small, sleek, simple/contemporary looking phone. I found the look but sacrificed everything else I needed in a cell phone. As with the other reviews, I found that the phone would OFTEN lock up when ending a call or even when simply navigating the functions. The only remedy for this was to remove the battery and re start. It would also constantly ask for a time confirmation while sending messages or when activating the unlock keypad feature. Despite the locked keypad, I could also switch on the key pad, switch off the ring tone, call friends and activate the web browser, all without me knowing. The scroll device could also be so sensitive that I would end up in functions I didn't want. The camera is a gimmick. Probably added at the last minute to keep up with a camera phone market, it was only just ok to take a picture in good light, when perfectly still and reasonably close, otherwise a hand drawn sketch would be better. Other issues included a weird, high pitch squeal in my ear from time to time, too many steps needed to navigate ANY function, a poorly visable display when in sunny conditions, and the occasional call dropping. With all that said, the old fashioned ring tone option did seem to impress both friends and strangers alike.\n", "This bra is completley worthless!

The pot is very difficult to put into or take out of the unit, requiring two hands. The pot leaks coffee onto the counter during the first pour, no matter how it is done. When the pot is taken out of the unit, coffee drips onto the heater plate, resulting in a scorched-coffee smell. It\'s hard to imagine how such a design failure made it into production.

After having googled this and read many reviews I have realized that this product is very poorly designed. Our coffee maker started by short cupping. Then I attempted to descale it by pouring literally gallons of vinegar through it per the descale instructions. This did nothing to remedy the problem. In fact the computer started to malfunction and pour all of the vinegar/water out without heating it. Descaling did not work. Finally after weeks of trying to fix it I have given up. Of course it is one month past the warranty so I have no recourse. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Numerous other consumers have had the same problem.

It usually starts with..."I\'ve had this product for 2 days and it works great" Fair warning.\n', 'This item arrived promptly and in good condition. My teenage son assembled it in a couple of hours before I arrived home from work, so I gather that it went together easily enough. The cart, being real wood, looks quite nice, but the legs, top, etc. are pieced together from multiple pieces of wood, which raises some questions in my mind about strength and long-term durability. If only it had lasted that long...After using the unit for less than a week, one of the casters disintegrated without warning (massive structural failure of the plastic housing) as I was pointing the cart in a different direction. We had a 27" CRT-based TV plus a DVD and VCR on the cart at the time, and luckily none of them fell off as the cart tipped sharply when the caster collapsed. Altogether it was about 100 lbs. of gear, but the cart is large enough that it should be designed to accommodate a significantly larger TV than the one we had on it.Comparing the casters on this cart with those on a smaller TV cart that we were replacing, I discovered that these were smaller and of lighter construction -- clearly undersized for this cart, which is a design flaw rather than a manufacturing problem. I drilled out the holes in the legs to accommodate the larger casters from the old cart (which we had used for a couple of years with the same TV/VCR/DVD setup), so I\'m hopeful that if the legs themselves don\'t give way, we\'ll be able to get some use out of this unit after all.To summarize, I would recommend this unit only for light duty use with small TV\'s.\n', 'I had one of the lower-end models for quite a while, and loved it. I decided to get this fancier machine and donate the older one to a friend.I am so disappointed in this machine. From day 1 it has leaked water all over the counter every time you use it. And the vibration as it is pulling in water to make a cup of coffee is so violent, that the coffee cup actually will "walk" off the machine unless I hold it in place.A search on Google for "keurig leaking" shows that this is a common problem. I\'m going to contact Keurig directly as they are apparently quite good about replacing the machine (although given how common the problem seems to be, I\'m not sure that\'s going to end up being the solution).In the end you just want a cup of coffee.

Despite several 'updates' at the VZW stores, nothing fixed the problem. About 5 months after I bought the phone it died. VZW would only replace the cherry with a cherry and the store was out. After calling customer service and threatening to cancel service, they gave me the mint chocolate...but with the cherry battery. And, you guessed it, I have had to update the mint numerous times because it does the same thing. A manager at the last VZW store told me that the reason LG redesigned the chocolates is due to the fact that the original version had 'problems'. A mint phone with a cherry battery is a testament to the poor cust svc from VZW.

I was wrong...very, very wrong. The keyboard itself is flimsy, much thinner than the $24 competitor I got. The power switch is incredibly flimsy, I can't tell if it's on or not. The keyboard seems much looser than the competitor when closed -- it's not very comforting. Tactile feedback is not as good as the cheaper alternative. And somehow, this keyboard drains my battery like crazy -- sending several short text messages with no other activity took my phone from 100% to 92%. This behavior happened more than once, and again the alternative does not show the same behavior. Even the charging port is flimsy, I really had to work to get the mini usb connector attached, and was afraid I was going to break it.The only reason this isn't one star is I have not experienced the pairing issues others have described. Price to quality ratio would make this less than one star, especially since all these issues are corrected in an alternative that costs a quarter as much.\n", "I bought these in August for my Father and he loved them. Upon visiting him this Christmas (4 months later), I discovered that he had stopped wearing them. The bottom had ripped away from the waist band and a button came off.

The second cup is just tinted water no matter how I try to adjust the cup. I don't know who thought this could really be done.The amount of water it puts out is very inconsistent. I always push for the largest cup and sometimes it only fills a quarter of the amount. I thought this could be because I didn't use it for a couple days and a pre-measured amount got evaporated, but it still does this, even with everyday use. Of course, when it only fills half the amount, it still doesn't utilize the K Cup and I just wasted another 50 cents.Nowadays I just use it for hot water and I've gone back to using tea bags and buying my morning coffee.

It is also fairly noisy (from a rattle, not from the wind). I bought a 5" O2 brand fan which is smaller, quieter and more effective. The O2 has the disadvantage (to me) of taking two D-size batteries but I was able to get a few hours out of it using AA batteries with up-sizing adapters.

Next morning it was deader than a door-nail.So, I took it back and got another one just like it. This time, I charged it for two hours and then talked on it for about 15 minutes. Next time I tried to use it, it was dead. It wouldn't even light up or respond in any way. Again, I charged it for two-hours and folded it up and put it in my shirt pocket.

And no, it wasn\'t a problem with Cingular\'s service because I have had other phones that have worked just fine in the same areas and I wasn\'t traveling at the time of these happenings.

I\'ve never had a razr before, but am so happy with it, (had it now for 2 weeks)! I do like to give phones a chance before I just return them, and I wont be returning the Razr.

This doesn't make a lot of sense to me, since chocolate seems like a pretty common candy thing to do, but the temperature gauge only goes down to 100 degrees, while tempering chocolate requires measuring down to ~84 degrees.While I'm not going to throw it away (it's still fine for deep frying), I'm going to need to find something else for doing chocolate.\n", 'I ordered this item based on the five stars given by another purchaser. I have as yet to use it. I am basing this review on the quality of the piece.When shredding cabbage, one must realize that the cabbage will contain some moisture. There is no protective finish on this slicer to repel moisture or keep it in good order when cleaning with soap and water. Also, when I tried out the sliding box that holds the cabbage, there was an area that the box would not readily slide through. Upon further investigation I found the base of the slicer was warped, where two diagonally opposite sides were not on the same plane as the other two sides. In essence, it was a rocking horse.It seems to me that before this thing leaves the manufacturer, someone should be checking the product.Very poor workmanship and quality even though a close grained wood was used in its production.I am presently warping this thing in the opposite direction before I apply a clear epoxy paint finish.\n', "Just what you need at home to replace those lost little screws from your different eyeglasses.

The text messaging system is awesome, the screen is nice and big with a good picture quality, and the size is an advantage. It also can be very loud if need be, although that wears the battery down rather quickly. It also has the advantage of having a USB port for a charger, which makes the likelihood of having a friend with the same charger higher. HOWEVER, it's small sliding size makes it a little bit fragile. After having this seemingly perfect phone for two and a half months, it is doing some weird things. First, it loses service extremely easily, which it did not do at first. That wouldn't be so bad if the screen didn't also go white whenever this happened. Whenever it whites out like that, I can't do anything; I can't look at pictures, or my numbers, and if I'm working on a textmessage, it gets lost and not saved to drafts. It happens all the time. Obviously this is extremely annoying, and it would seem that the phone is either badly designed, or broken. I have not been unusually rough on this phone, so I don't believe that it should be broken so early on in it's lifespan. My best guess is that the rizer is a problem prone phone, and I would think twice about buying one if I were you.\n", "My wife wanted one of the new Bluetooth phones, and of course that meant her hands free car kit would no longer work. So the choice was to buy her a cordless hands free headset or another several hundred to install a new car kit. After a protracted review process, I chose the Jabra 250 as it seemed to be the most comfortable to wear and it seemed to have the best volume incoming and outgoing as well from what we looked at on the market, even though it is only using Bluetooth 1.1. Now that we bought it, I'm blown away, this unit is truly amazing. We are using it on the new Moto MPx 220 and it works like a champ. You hardly notice that you are even wearing it, and it has enough incoming volume to blow you away if you don't turn it down. Outgoing volume is good as well. The unit would have received a 5 star rating if it was using Bluetooth 1.2. What I have determined after reading many reviews that were great and those that said the unit was not very good, is that I tend to believe it has to do with the phone it is matched up to. A new high quality phone should work great with this as it does for us. Hope this helps and thanks for all the reviews I was able to read to get me to this point.\n", 'This phone is worthless. I have now had it for 3 years and felt I may as well give my input in case anyone else was considering buying it since I am researching a new phone. Here are my main issues with this phone:- The User Interface is horrid. I am a web developer and usability engineer so I can state that as a fact. The UI on Nokias is 10x better. The fact that I still hate the UI after 3 years should really tell you something. This issue alone is 90% of the reason I hate this phone.- Dropped calls. Poor reception. Once again nothing like my old Nokias (which were all free Cingular phones.) I also have the antenna "upgrade". Made no difference AT ALL.- Side volume controls. I used to always want a phone with convenient volume controls on the side until I got this. If it is in your pocket (or purse if you are female) you will find the buttons get hit all the time and will turn your vibrate on and off and make your phone beep. Obviously this problem isnt specific to this phone but it is something to consider in cellphone design.On the plus side, the phone is generally always reliable. The volume is decent. The speaker has held up better over time than my Nokias did (they had noticable volume degradation over time).Also, it wasn\'t until recently until the battery starting having problems holding a decent charge. I got in a solid 2 years of good battery/charger performance.

Not so with my Samsung or other phones that I have had. The manual is a waste of good trees. It doesn't give you more than the most basic information on the operation and set up of the phone, and for a complete description, it is necessary to go to the web for instructions.

Because my local hardware store carries them, and they are readily available elsewhere, and I have opted for form over function. Every single Umbra rod I have used fails drastically. They simply cannot bear any weight. Or, to put it differently, they cannot exert enough force against the surfaces they extend out to for them to bear any load.

That part is all true; the problem is the people who designed it seemed to think you should spray the surface with water for a while and then run the vacuum.... DUMB! Not only that, the sprayer mostly makes a little pt.pt.pt.pt sound and spits a little, taking forever to get the surface wet. Then it\'s all soaked in before you can flip the switch to the vacuum setting.SO I have used it to stem a couple of spots from furniture, but it\'s completely useless for its stated and intended purpose.Please, America, why can\'t you build us a good, simple, spot cleaner?\n', 'I received two of these in a sampler package I had ordered through Keurig.com I made one cup, added my Coffeemate and Splenda...and...EWW! It was so bad I poured the rest down the sink and threw away the other K-Cup. I will not be ordering this variety EVER.\n', "Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received. Out of 10, 6 were black, 3 red (2 shades), 1 pink. I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different (and I mean different - not all red-toned) colors, but not with what I got. Useless.I'm upset beyond words. Will never buy from this seller again, and will not recommend to anyone I know, unless the seller comes through and fixes this.\n", 'I personally think Plantronics Voyager 510 is still the best choice to go.I love my Plantronics Voyager 510, too bad I lost it.I bought this one because it seems like it is a new product.I dang made a wrong choice...Plantronics Voyager 510 felt so comfortable when put it on the ear, but this one just hurts my ear like hell!\n', "PROs: 1000 Contacts, Photo and Video, Ringtone and picture ID.Cons: Photo quality is average. Call quality is below average. Phone becomes slow after months of use. Text messages sometimes refuse to send.Overall: I miss my nokia with the alarm clock that rings even when the phone is off. Huge regret getting this phone. What I like best is the Ringtone ID's. I know who is calling by the ringtone the phone plays.\n", "First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!\n", "I purchased our Emer from Sears almost two years ago, and it broke within a month. We sent it back to New Jersey, and it took two months to have it returned. Within a month it was broken. Now it is a pile of plastic and I don't know what to do with it. Very disappointed in product and service.\n", 'This pouch arrived already torn of damaged at the corner. This kind of item takes a lot of opening and closing wear and this one would not last long at all.\n', "I bought two of these bat girl costumes for my two daughters. The masks started falling apart after the first time wearing them. The material was so cheap it literally fell apart!!! I was SO disappointed! By the time Halloween came I had completely redone the masks and stapled the silver belt back together.I have never rated anything before but I couldn't help myself, I want people to know what they are buying.\n", "The suspenders I ordered were just what I was looking for and they were delivered in a timely fashion in time for my boyfriend's birthday!\n", 'The battery came and it was obviously not a new battery as advertised. If I paid more than a few bucks - I would send it back.\n', 'I waited for this thing to become available. Wasted my time. It never would charge with my Palm charger and charged only once with battery set up. The on-off switch is flimsy and the charging methodology is totally crazy; you have to find a way to prop the charging stand up vertically.Palm makes great cell phone PDAs but should find someone other than Plantronics to make their headsets (this piece of #@?! really tarnishes the Palm name).\n', 'The price is high considering that there are newer models.\n', "I've never really had shirts 'break apart' like these did. They looked ok for a couple of washes but afterwards they completely fell apart. Simply a bad product. Not worth the cheap price.\n", "After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper.\n", "This warmer doesn't even begin to keep coffee warm. Don't waste your time or money. Very disappointed given the Mr. Coffee brand...\n", "This bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable. The lace cups isn't feel like flour sack material.\n", 'After 2nd or 3rd usage, inside of the pots started to tarnished (not a food stain). Now the food cooked using these tarnished pots are tasting bit bitter (metallic taste). Very poor quality product.\n', 'Aside from the fact that it took two weeks for my order to arrive, once it finally arrived the shirt appeared to be a knockoff. In comparison to another Duofold item I purchased from another seller, this shirt is clearly inferior - not only is the material different but the tag appears to be an iron-on copy with several of the words blacked out. I would never buy from this seller again.\n', "I only wear Olga bras because of the way they are designed in the back--they are the only bras that do not slip off my narrow shoulders. This one is the one I buy most of the time, as it does have a minimizing effect. The sizes are slightly different from other bras--it's best to try one on in the store to get your size, then buy from Amazon because of the price. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a little too see-through; I would prefer a thicker lining.\n", "I've had one house guest and one nanny place this kettle on my gas stove believing it's a standard kettle. The first time, I wrote Cuisinart a letter, and they graciously sent me a new kettle. Great customer service. The second time, I'm going with a less confusing design, the Capresso glass electric kettle for a couple extra bucks. It's not worth burning my house down ; ).This design looks just like Cusinart's other standard kettles. So if you have elderly parents, or people what are not familiar with recent developments in water boiling, you might want to consider a less confusing design. (p.s. the plastic base melts in seconds if it comes in contact with a heat source).\n", 'It looks good and functions well but the temperature is just not quite as hot as most coffee and tea drinkers prefer. Another 10-15 degrees and it would be perfect.\n', 'My daughter chose this messenger bag because of the print, but we hadn\'t realized it wasn\'t a regular size messenger bag. That was our mistake for not looking at the product dimensions, but it never occurred to me that a bag labelled as a "messenger bag" would be so small. She cannot fit her folders or homework book in it. We have found another use for it, but she was disappointed nonetheless.\n', "I have tried this item a few times and learned:The strainer top does not hold tight to the cooker, nor is there anything in the design of the cooker part to permit the strainer top to attach to it. This means that when you tip the cooker over to pour out the water, the top falls off! Danger of scalding and steam burns!It worked adequately for rice vermicelli, which one would normally just soak in boiling water anyway. When I tried it with penne, the pasta pieces on the bottom of the container didn't even get wet from the hot water, never mind cooked! I still had to remove the pasta at the end of the so-called cooking time, and transfer it to a pot of boiling water in order to get it cooked!This so-called pasta cooker is a waste of time. Not a waste of money if you want to have a plastic vase for long-stemmed flowers... that's what you can safely use it for!\n", 'Great fabric and tight fit. Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall, then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso. This company does not listen to the customer.\n', "Doesn't matter that you drive a gas-guzzlin' SUV or live in a nice house that's paid for - paying for serious bandwidth can be painful. Share your pain with other geeks, and confuse the riff-raff.\n", "These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore. the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!!\n", 'These blankets are not &#34;gray&#34;. They are a multi colored mish mash of wool fibers. Probably useful as an emergencty blanket but not an attractive looking item.\n', 'Product was small to size. Return policy sucks so I kept it. Perhaps I can pass it on to someone else......\n', 'I bought this phone about fifteen months ago and was initially very pleased. Lots of features, really cool sounding stereo sound from the stereo speakers. But.... I use my cell phone average 1500 minutes a month. The slide does not hold up. The phone sections separated on one side, I got a sim card failure message on the phone screen and the off button would not turn the phone off. Removed the battery and it is now dead on my desk, will not turn on with battery reinstalled. $300 for fifteen months is a little pricey.\n', "I was so excited to finally be getting a rice cooker stateside! But I hate this one. Here are the reasons:1) No handles for the pot. I can't take the pot for the rice out without using a potholder or towel. There are no handles for easy lifting in and out.2) Pot is not secure. When I want to get my rice out, I have to use a towel or potholder to hold onto the pot because it won't stay still when I'm scooping out my rice.3) No beep for finished rice. Why isn't there a beep or a noise to indicate when the rice is done cooking?4) Over-warms rice. I left the cooker on with rice in it overnight, and instead of being yummy the next morning, it was mostly dried out and hard. What a waste of rice!In retrospect, I should have shipped my original rice cooker back with me from Japan. It had all these features, and I got it third-hand. Pay the extra money to get a real Japanese one, not an import.\n", 'After reading all of the reviews for the FM transmitters I decided I would go the cassette adapter way. It worked for about 2 songs then the player kept spitting it out. One of the reasons that I bought it was the power adapter that came with it. Maybe someone will get smart and make one of these things that actually WORKS!']'''
